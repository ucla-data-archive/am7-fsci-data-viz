This is an introduction to creating figures in R using the package `ggplot2`. We will show how to read data into R using a few sources, including the data repository **Dataverse**. We then will introduce `ggplot2`, which we think provides an elegant and lego-like way to provide an introduction to dataviz. It implements a `grammar of graphics` that lets users layer graphical elements in a modular and adaptable way.
